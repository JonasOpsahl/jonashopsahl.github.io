### About Me

I am a hungry, eager and engaged 23 year old student who loves new challenges. I work well in teams and get along well with others, while I also have no problem working alone. I take great pride in my tasks and I am not afraid to take initiative. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science with specialization in data science and have recently started a joint masters in software engineering at the University of Bergen and HVL.
